=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper - Vivify a Git::Wrapper instance for Dist::Zilla

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper;

    my $wrapper =  Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper->new( zilla => $self->zilla );

    $wrapper->log(); # etc.

Yes, this does very little, but simply serves as an abstraction for getting a Git::Wrapper
object from git, mostly, because everyone remembers C<< $self->zilla >>, but you have to RTFM
and go source diving to know about C<< $self->zilla->root >>

This is a simple straight forward way of doing what you want with the least mental overhead.

Everything else is just proxy methods for C<< git >>

This is a more I.O.C approach to my swathes of C<< Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::LocalRepository >> stuff,
which got so complex with dependency management my head exploded.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<zilla>

Parameter lazily required, and should be a Dist::Zilla object ( or compatible )

=head2 C<git>

A Git::Wrapper instance. Optional, and pointless to specify manually,
but could be useful for testing where you don't want Dist::Zilla

Vivified if not specified based on the C<zilla> parameter.
