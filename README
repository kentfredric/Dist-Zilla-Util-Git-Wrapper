NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper - Vivify a Git::Wrapper instance for
    Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.002000

SYNOPSIS
        use Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper;

        my $wrapper =  Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Wrapper->new( zilla => $self->zilla );

        $wrapper->log(); # etc.

    Yes, this does very little, but simply serves as an abstraction for
    getting a Git::Wrapper object from git, mostly, because everyone
    remembers "$self->zilla", but you have to RTFM and go source diving to
    know about "$self->zilla->root"

    This is a simple straight forward way of doing what you want with the
    least mental overhead.

    Everything else is just proxy methods for "git"

    This is a more I.O.C approach to my swathes of
    "Dist::Zilla::Role::Git::LocalRepository" stuff, which got so complex
    with dependency management my head exploded.

ATTRIBUTES
  "zilla"
    Parameter lazily required, and should be a Dist::Zilla object ( or
    compatible )

  "git"
    A Git::Wrapper instance. Optional, and pointless to specify manually,
    but could be useful for testing where you don't want Dist::Zilla

    Vivified if not specified based on the "zilla" parameter.
